							<strong>Something Forgotten</strong>
							<br>
							<p>When some things are lost, they never return.  Sebastian wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand before opening the front door of his apartment.  The smell of damp carpet wafted in and replaced that of the freshly painted walls.  He reached out his hand and she introduced herself.</p> <p>“I’m Bella, the super.”</p>
	<p>She handed him a sheet of paper with information about garbage pickup and told him that rent was due on the first of each month.  With her foot, she rolled back a small piece of carpeting that had a tear and looked down at it.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll put in a work order for the floors.” She peeked into his apartment.  On the far side, across his living-room stood his family’s beaten-up Wurlitzer.  The fist-sized hole in the piano’s facade matched the chipped cream-colored bricks that served as a backdrop and far wall of his apartment.  //the cream-colored bricks as backdrop//
		Sebastian turned his head back to his super and was met with the stern face of disapproval.</p>
		<p>“Don’t worry.” he told her, “It’s only a decoration.” The words sat sourly on his tongue.
		“In the summer, the conservatory down the road plays with their windows open and I swear they put the worst musicians right up next to the windows.  I would move, but I’m somewhat bound to this building.” 
	“Bella,” an elderly voice wheezed from down the hall.  
	“We’re right down the hall if you need anything.  It was nice--”Before she could continue, the voice called for her again.
	He watched her as she turned and walked down the hall and into her apartment before closing his door and returning to the sofa in the middle of his living-room.  From the couch, Sebastian had a view out of the two windows that led to the fire escape.  Behind him, separated by a small breakfast bar, was his kitchen.  The door was just to his left a few feet behind his right shoulder and made a tapping sound as it moved back and forth slightly, bouncing from one side of the dead-bolt to the other.  He walked past the kitchen to his bedroom and pushed down on the window until it clicked, shutting out the breeze from Lake Michigan a few blocks away.  //the breeze, late summer//
	He closed his bedroom door and was pleased with the silence of his apartment as the wind no longer moved the door.  Thirsty, he walked to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water.  It smelled a bit foul, but he drank it regardless.  Through his glass, the piano in front of him across the island looked distorted and strange.  He remembered the first time he sat in front of it as a child, intent on making it his own.
	Down the hall, Bella pulled an oxygen tank from a crate in the closet of her dining room.  The living room was dark, save the flashes on the television and the yellowish glow of the ceiling fan light. //the tank is green and metallic; it reflects the choppy light from the ceiling fan above as she opens the blinds and then the window// The old man, her father, winced as the light poured into the apartment and onto the pictures hanging around the room.  A few were of Bella and her mother standing in front of the Schroeder Conservatory of Music, only blocks away.  There was another of Bella’s father in his dress blues, arm in arm in a group of uniformed men.  She wheeled the tank next to her father’s recliner and untangled the remote controller from the cords of his nasal cannula.  He groaned, but smiled when he turned and saw her face.
	“Beautiful girl, so much like your mother,” he told her as he brushed the hair away from her face, but his eyesight had grown old with him.  In comparison to her mother, Bella was unremarkable.
	“You look hungry,” she said and walked into the kitchen.  Her father turned back to the television and raised the volume, drowning out the clang of kitchen sounds -- pots and pans, as well as the knocking at the door.
	Sebastian, on the other side, heard the television and decided he’d come back some other time.  As he turned towards the staircase, he looked around the hall, taking in his new apartment building, and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk.  
	He walked the roundabout way to his interview at the post-office, around the conservatory, making sure to double-check both ways before crossing the streets.  The clouds above Sebastian hung heavy, ready to burst.  //cumulonothings in the stratosomething// He didn’t seem to notice and kept his eyes out in front of him as the cars passed.  His knuckles were white around the edges and sweat pushed out from the cracks of his skin.  As the little green man parted the sea of cars that separated Sebastian from the post office, the clouds above opened up and rain began to pour.  For the first time since leaving the apartment building, he moved his gaze away from the street, upwards towards the point of the Federal Building’s tower, then ran under one of its five imposing arches.
	He stood hunched with his hands on his knees, smiling slightly, as he turned his head to his right, breathing heavily. A friend from his past crossed his mind as he remembered times they would run from the rain until they reached similar arches. His smile faded as he stood all the way up, alone.
	Sebastian opened his jacket, pulled out a folded newspaper, and checked the printed address against the oak doors before him.  With the paper tucked under his arm, he pulled the handle and the golden atrium of the building opened up above him and echoed squeaky footsteps, muffled voices, and the hollow boom of the door closing behind him.    
	Mike O’Donnell’s rosy red cheeks glowed in the lobby of the post-office as he walked out from behind the counter to greet Sebastian.  His movement was closer to that of a penguin’s wobble than an upright stride.
	“O’Donnell,” he said grabbing Sebastian’s hand with both of his, “but the Mrs. calls me ‘cherry-cheeks.’” He rolled his shoulders back in a gesture, that Sebastian interpreted as happiness-in-marriage, and the space between the top three buttons of his sky blue uniform separated, revealing the stained yellow ribs of his tank-top undershirt.  His shoulders came back to a resting position and the gaps closed.  
	As Sebastian followed Mike past the counter towards the room where prospective employees, current employees, and stray custodians tested their mail-sorting skills, he noticed that the other post-workers’ faces were in stark contrast to Mike’s, though a few seemed to share the frostbitten, rosy cheeks, none of which were smiling.  
	They stopped at the end of the hall where three doors stood closed.  Mike turned so that the two men faced each other.  He motioned left, “This is the old sorting room,” then right, “and this is my office,” he said, pulled out his keys, and opened the door.  
	As he passed the threshold, Mike pulled his arms inwards at the elbows to fit through the frame.  Sebastian paused to notice the space between his own body and the doorway.  He looked down at his shoulders, which were a body width on each side from the door and the dark spots from on his coat from the rain.  He looked past Mike, towards the window, as the frequency of drops on the glass increased.  
	The desk facing the wall took up half of the office and Mike in his swivel chair took up most of the other.  Sebastian was left standing within the doorway, unsure if he should squeeze into the office or back away into the hall, while Mike produced a clipboard from a drawer below.
	“Application for the Clerk position, this is the easy part.  I just need you to fill out the top half and then--”
	“Clerk?” Sebastian asked as he held out the classified ad to show Mike, “The ad says clerk, carrier, and reception positions available.  I was hoping I could apply to be a carrier.”
	“Oh, uh,” Mike poked at the paper with his finger and then handed the clipboard over, “I guess I ran the old ad without taking a good look at it.  We’ve been in a bit of a flux since our automated mail sorter went down.”
	Sebastian’s hands trembled as he clicked the pen and brought it to the application.  The penmanship was shaky and unfamiliar to him.  He squeezed tightly to keep the pen from falling and by the time he had finished writing down his information, the edges were smeared with inky thumb and forefinger prints.  A look of concern crept onto Mike’s face as he watched Sebastian struggle with the form.  He set the clipboard down onto the desk and wiped the sweat and ink onto his pants legs.  //small bits of both, everywhere//
	“Last part, follow me across the hall,” he motioned to the door behind Sebastian and stood up.  The two shuffled around each other awkwardly for a moment.  “How about you lead the way?” 
	Sebastian smiled before reaching for the door behind him.  The sign at Sebastian’s eye level read, ‘Custodian’ and he hesitated.  “Is this right?”
	The room, refurbished with a matrix of cubbies atop a large wooden table, still had a rusted steel mop sink in the corner and gave off the odor of cleaning supplies.  Above them, one bare light bulb hung from a braided cord.  There was a discoloration of bricks in the shape of a window on the rear wall //or it was series of 3x4 glass window blocks that passed grayish distorted light through the closet-like room//.  
	Mike seemed in his element sitting on the stool with three worn legs in front of the matrix of wooden cubbies.  He brought his hands through a stretching routine that was hauntingly familiar to Sebastian and then pulled a carton of laminated envelopes from beneath the table.  
	“Would you hit that timer by the door?” Mike said as he adjusted his bifocals from their awkward angle and began to methodically flip the envelopes into the appropriate slots.  
	"Our automated mail sorting system went down last month and we've been struggling to get it repaired.  That beast of a machine is much more expensive and complicated to repair than I'd anticipated, so we've had to retrograde for the time being." Mike paged through three envelopes with the same zip code and pushed them into the matrix.  "When I first started working for the Post this is how we sorted all mail, and when the sorting machine was installed, the people upstairs put me in charge of branch operations and all the other sorting clerks were either let go or turned into carriers.  Out on the main floor, an operating clerk will send you a bin to be sorted, here." Mike pointed to the shelf underneath the table labeled, "conveyor belt" with masking tape and permanent marker.  "And when a truck is ready to go out, he'll call for a specific postal code.  Then you just grab the letters from that cubby, put it in the bin, and send it off.  " Mike continued working subconsciously in rhythm with the patter of rain against the glass blocks.
		Six minutes passed.  Mike pulled the last envelope from the bin and flicked it into the slot labeled '53208.' 
		Mike stood from the stool and slapped the timer, "six-thirty-six is the time to beat," he jested, "If you're not fast at first," he said, pulling the envelopes from the slots, "you'll get better with time." As he shuffled the laminated envelopes //the furnace behind them whirs and roasts Sebastian's back// his fingers lacked the grace they exhibited when flipped through them.  They were fat and red.
		Sebastian switched places with Mike and faced the table.  The rows and columns seemed now to tower over him.  He was reminded of the tower of the Federal Building that he was in and the rain dripping down the sides of the granite and began to sweat in front of the furnace.
		Sebastian reached below and pulled up the bin, immediately pulling out a sizable stack of envelopes.  The first was labeled '53201.' Starting with his eyes on the top left corner of the matrix he looked down a row and then a column systematically.  The cubby was in the second column, first row.  That was easy.  '53706,' was the next.  Again starting on the top left hand corner he found the cubby and placed the letter inside.
		After two minutes and thirty envelopes, Sebastian knew where all the locations were and now only needed to read the numbers and place the letters.  As he tried to move faster, his hands began to cramp and tighten.  He worked at a steady pace before his hands were covered with sweat and he dropped a letter before it reached its slot.  His hands fumbled about as he tried to remove the letter from the wooden desk.  It was sticky and Sebastian wiped it off on his leg before filing into the slot.  He tried to make circles with his wrists, but couldn’t get them to rotate as far as they once did.
		“Not so good with your hands?”
		“I’ve had some surgeries,” Sebastian said as set down the stack of envelopes and opened his palms under the light, turning to show Mike the three scars on his left hand and one on his right.  Neither men spoke as Sebastian moved finger by finger trying to touch his palm.  His left thumb made it, but the first finger stopped bending at the knuckle.  The middle and ring finger were stuck halfway between bent and erect and moved together slowly.  The pinky bowed normally, but outward at a misshapen angle. His right hand had a normal range of motion, but trembled noticeably as he opened and closed it.  
		“I’m not going to be able to do this every day.”  Sebastian wiped his palm on his shirt before shaking Mike’s hand and walking out from the interview.  He walked out under the arches of the building and stood before the wall of water.  He pulled out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth with his right hand.  Then, again with his right hand, he reached around into his left pocket and pulled out a lighter.  It rained harder as he lit his cigarette.
		“You can’t smoke under here,” a security guard said from behind Sebastian, “twenty feet from the doors.”
		Sebastian popped the collar of his coat and took two steps into the rain.
		“That’s better,” the man said retreating into the Federal building.
		For ten minutes, Sebastian stood and smoked his cigarette under the rain in front of the Romanesque arches and granite tower until a bus pulled in front of him.  He put two crumpled bills into the machine and sat with his head pressed against the glass.  He thought about the last time he rode a bus.  It was before he had gotten his license, years ago.
	In middle school, Sebastian’s social studies teacher presented material on the Harlem Renaissance and then the Golden Age of Jazz in the Milwaukee Bronzeville neighborhood.  Sebastian had been a long time fan of Dizzy Gillespie and his iconic bent trumpet.  When he learned that the trumpeter performed in Milwaukee, he thought he should see the historic spot.  He took the 21 up North Ave from the East Side.  
	He stood in front of a brightly painted building with boarded windows and two signs: one was painted and read “Milwaukee Inner City Arts Council.” The other was plastic and read: “Public Library.”
	He walked west towards where Maxie’s Jazz Club once stood.  In its place was Interstate 43.  Sebastian stood on the overpass looking down at the cars speeding out from underneath him, north away from Milwaukee.  He felt robbed and tried to imagine how Dizzy Gillespie sounded in front of a Milwaukee crowd, but the cars and concrete blocked it out.  The exhaust that burned Sebastian’s nostrils would have surely been too much for Dizzy to play through.  The club that once stood here had long been displaced by the freeway that passed //or gouged a white artery// through Bronzeville.  Sebastian’s cheeks reddened and his head hung low as he walked.
	Sebastian was ripped from his thoughts as the bus he was on screeched to a halt at a yellow light.  The rain on the bus subdued and the sky above Lake Michigan had cleared.  At the next stop, he got off the bus and walked the few blocks back to his apartment building.
	His face was wet, but without tension -- caught between a smile and a frown.  He played his favorite Dizzy Gillespie on the stereo and sank into his couch with his feet on the coffee table.  
	Across the hall, Bella’s father began to snore upright in his chair.  Bella dried her hands on a dish towel and walked into the living room to turn off the television and take off her father’s glasses.  She placed them on the table beside his oxygen tank and moved towards the kitchen.
	I could use a drink, she thought, opening the fridge.  She stopped short as she heard the music coming from Sebastian’s apartment.  She shut the refrigerator and poked her head into the hallway.  The music grew louder as she walked down towards his apartment and knocked on the door.
	The knock stopped Sebastian’s head from bouncing to the beat and his foot from tapping.  He turned down the music and opened the door.
	“Is there a problem?” he asked Bella, who stood in the hallway that was -- in contrast to his darkened apartment -- bright.
	“Is that Dizzy?”
	“You’re a fan?” he asked excitedly, and motioned for her to come inside.  He turned up the lights and the music.  “I was afraid I was being too loud.”
	“Not at all.”
	“Would you like something to drink?” Sebastian asked, but emerged with two beers from the refrigerator before waiting for an answer.  When he handed her the bottle, she saw the scars on his hand.  She withdrew for a moment before grabbing the beer.  
	Sebastian looked down at his hands and then the piano against the wall.  
	“I was in a car accident,” he said, “while--” 
	The phone rang.  “Do you mind?” he asked, standing up.  Bella bowed her head and gestured towards the phone, then took a sip from her beer.  
	When Sebastian recognized the voice on the other end of the line, his voice raised an octave.  
	“Marco, shit, how’s life at school?” 
	Bella tried politely not to eavesdrop, but found that impossible.  Across the kitchen counter, Sebastian paced and talked and occasionally remembered that Bella was waiting.  The music stopped and Bella no longer had anything to distract her from listening.  She overheard talk of a college visit and assumed this friend of Sebastian’s was a student.  Bella noticed a change in his tone of voice, whenever he mentioned someone by the name Izzy.  
	From the living room, Bella heard Sebastian quiet to a whisper and wondered what the person on the other end was saying.  She twirled the nearly empty bottle in her hand and then brought it to her lips.  While walking to the kitchen to toss out the empty beer, she realized that she hadn’t yet eaten.  The effects of the beer made her sway and she decided it would be good to leave.
	“I’ve got to run, see you around,” she said, placing the bottle on the counter.  Sebastian mouthed a quick, “Sorry” before she walked back to her apartment.
	After he hung up, he walked to his couch, stimulated by the conversation with his childhood friend. He sat with his beer and thought of the days at the conservatory; he thought of his teacher; he thought of Marco; and he thought of Isabella. 
	A few days later, Sebastian opened the door of his apartment to let in his great aunt Beatrice.  She took two steps into the apartment and with a reserved smile, looked from one end of the apartment to the other.  “I’m glad you brought the Wurlitzer,” she said, staring at the piano.  She closed the door and sat down on the sofa.  “Do you remember when you first sat down at that piano?”
	“It’s fuzzy,” he said and almost immediately, Beatrice began to reminisce.  
	Sebastian was seven years old when he tripped and slid face-first into the pedals of the family’s piano.  As he stood up, he bumped the back of his head on the shelf of the piano.  He began to cry and ran upstairs to find his Aunt.
		“What have I told you about running in the house?” she asked as she bandaged the small cut across his forehead.  He looked up at her face and saw her disapproval through the wrinkles and crow’s feet; he tried to speak between the tears //hiccups and salt//.
		“My ball,” he said.
		“Go ahead and fetch it then, but remember to play safe now.”
		She sent him downstairs to look for his ball under the piano.  Carefully this time, he bent down and looked under the piano.  Between the dust and cobwebs, he couldn’t see his ball.  He thought it might be behind the piano and so he climbed atop the bench and jumped to the key cover, avoiding the large hole that appeared to be the work of termites.  Tightly clinging to the upright piano, he tried to look behind it.  As he leaned, the cover began to slide off.  He righted himself, nearly falling.  Curious, he turned the cover over completely and stared into the opening.  Rows of dusty strings and hammers lead down into the darkness.  He looked along each downward string and wondered if he would be able to see his ball at the bottom.  He moved from the far right side of the piano towards the left, eyes fixed inside.  Reaching the hole, his foot slipped and landed on a few of the white keys.  He watched as the hammers met the string and filled his great Aunt’s house with a heavy thud.
		She came angrily down the stairs and within moments she was standing at the bottom of the stairs with one hand on her hip.
		“What’s with all that noise?”
		“I still can’t get my ball,” He said as she moved towards the boy and the piano.  With her long gangly arms she reached beneath the piano and pulled out the toy ball.  He asked her about the piano and she told him that it had been in the family a long time.
		“It was my mother’s.  She tried to teach me when I was little,” she said, “but I never had the touch, I suppose.” She sat at the bench next to him and began to play a simple song with just three of the keys.  She finished with a crack of her knuckles and walked upstairs to apply anti-inflammatory arthritis ointment to her hands.  A few minutes later she came back down the stairs and watched as the boy continued to stare at the piano, mesmerized.   
		Beatrice got up from the sofa in Sebastian’s apartment and sat down at the piano.  “Do you remember this one?” she said and with one hand, played the song she played for him as a little boy.  As Sebastian listened to his aunt play, the memory of a song rushed into his mind.  He heard the song playing through from the beginning.  It was one that he had written himself, while in the hospital.  Sebastian’s eyes began to water so he shut them tight and wiped his sleeve over them.  
		“Have you seen Isabella recently?” Beatrice asked, turning around on the bench to face Sebastian.  Thoughts of Isabella pushed the song from Sebastian’s head.
	“It’s been a while.”
	“Oh, well...” She continued talking to him about how sweet this girl seemed.  Sebastian drifted to thoughts of Isabella, when they met.  It was the same day he met Marco.
	Not long after Sebastian was introduced to the piano, did he convince his mother to sign him up for piano lessons at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music.  
	That day, Sebastian, along with two others, was assigned to Maestro La Guiré, a tall woman with flowing black hair and the smallest hint of a mustache.  There were two pianos; the Maestro sat at the first with Marco and Sebastian shared a bench with a tiny-framed blonde, Isabella, who he would later know just as ‘Izzy.’
	That day they learned proper posture as well as correct hand placement.  Blank sheet music was presented and explained to the students.  Sebastian was fascinated and in what seemed like five minutes, the two-hour session was over and the students were on their way out.  There hadn’t been much time for conversation during the lesson, but afterwards, Sebastian looked at Isabella and sent her the cheesiest of smiles.  She blushed and turned away from him, but he could see her cheekbones poking out at the sides from her own smile.  //cartoonish, the way memories sometimes manifest themselves//
		“Have you?” Beatrice said, placing her hand on his arm, pulling him from his daydream.  
		“Sorry, have I what?”
		“Found a job?” she asked, while opening her purse.  //gray clutch, off-white, dirty// Before Sebastian could respond, Beatrice had ripped a note from her checkbook and tucked it into his shirt-pocket.  She grabbed his chin and gave him a look of loving superiority before letting herself out.
		Slowly, the song from earlier crept into his head; soft at first, it grew steadily louder, until Sebastian could not bear it.  He turned the stereo up and sat back on the couch with a beer.
		He began to doze off and his beer nearly slipped from his hand as he a knock on the door woke him.
		“Wine?” the super asked, holding a bottle in the frame of his door, “I heard the music and wondered what you were up to.” Sebastian let her in and grabbed a glass. “There was a woman in the hall as I headed over. Your mother?”
		“Aunt,” he said, “she’s my only family still in the city.” 
		“Yeah, it’s just me and my dad as well.” She went on for a while, talking about her father, emphysema, and his declining health. As the wine ran low, she spoke more freely and smiled with an occasional wink. Sebastian’s eyes hung low as he tried to stay engaged.
	“You look tired,” she said, “I should go. She left the empty bottle and glass on the table.
	That night, as Sebastian lay sprawled on his couch, red flashing light beamed in from the edges of Sebastian’s curtains and illuminated his apartment.  Engine sounds, stomping, and muffled voices trickled into the apartment from the hall. Sebastian thought there was a garbage truck and panicked as he had forgotten to move the dumpsters, but as he looked at the date on his watch, he realized it was not collection day. He cracked open his door and heard slight sobs as Bella’s father was wheeled out.
	He shut the door quietly and went to his room as the truck drove off sans sirens. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he wondered if ‘Bella’ was short for something. He let himself fall backwards, tracing the cracks of his ceiling that had been painted over, trying to remember the last time he saw Izzy. It was the summer after his high school graduation and accident.  He thought about her often while he was bedridden. When he was well enough to walk, they met for coffee. She had shared her plans and Sebastian was enthralled by their level of comfort with each other, the beauty he now saw in her, and her proximity to the musical world.
	Isabella grabbed his arm to help him stand as they readied themselves to leave and Sebastian leaned in for a kiss.
	“Seba,” she said, with a smile that was both friendly and tranquilizing, before turning quietly towards the door.
	A few weeks went by before Sebastian saw his super again. She was trying to move out her father’s old chair and struggling to get it through the door.
	“Let me, please,” he offered and grabbed one side of the chair and pulled it to the curb out front. She stared blankly for a moment before thanking him and they walked back inside. 
	She peeked through the door at the rectangular mark that the chair had left on the floor and then turned to Sebastian. 
	“How about a beer?” he asked, “In my apartment.”
	She agreed and they walked to his sofa. She looked around the room and noticed how little it had changed since he moved in.
	“That’s a nice piano,” she said, waiting for Sebastian to return with beer.
	“It’s been in my family for a while,” he said, placing the beers on a folded classifieds section of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. She asked him for a story and he saw the red around her eyes and obliged.
	“I remember the first time I saw this piano.  I was seven and my mother dropped me off to stay at my Aunt’s house for a day during the summer.  If I had to choose a word to describe her house when I first walked in, it would be ‘gray.’ Her hair was the first thing I think of when I picture her. I walked in and she towered over me and my mother, bent down to give me a kiss on the forehead as I scrunched my face in embarrassment.”
	“Did you play?” she asked.
	Sebastian held out his hands and showed her his scars. 
	“I did,” he said, offered a brief biography and then told another story.
	“There was this girl that I used to play with since we were little. Senior year of high school, we were to perform for the conservatory’s annual Fall showcase and a few members from admission boards of music schools use these high-pressure concerts as admissions requirements.  We practiced for months, but the night before our duet, I tried to get to bed early, but couldn’t sleep. When I woke up, I realized I had slept through my alarm. I was getting ready for an audition, for music school, and I had fixed a tie and suit together so fast. I was impressed with myself.
	“I used to live not to far from where the performance was to take place, and so when I saw my bus leaving without me, I ran.
	They say never to chase down a bus if you miss it, but this was important. ”
		He went back to the kitchen for more beer. 
		“I ran into a bicyclist and fell into the street. Then, a car ran over my hands,” he handed her the beers and held out his hands again, “do you mind opening them?”
		They drank and talked until both passed out. When Sebastian woke up, She had made breakfast for them both. They ate quietly, until Sebastian tried to bring up Bella’s father.
		“Have you heard of ‘Jazz in the Park’?” she asked, avoiding the subject, “it’s every Thursday on the square.”
		“I can’t this week, but soon?”
		“Oh, I didn’t, I mean,” she said, “Of course.” She cleared her plate and walked back to her apartment.
		She remembered the newspaper on his table and sat down with her phone to her ear on the edge of her bed. The man on the other end of the phone seemed to know Bella and they talked about nothing for a while, before the man offered his condolences and she asked for a favor.
		Sebastian spent the day on the phone as well, paging through the newspaper with rings from the night before. 
	He picked up the phone, “Is there still an opening?”
	“...”
	“Well, thanks anyway.” Sebastian made several more phone calls like this one, before he left to the bank to deposit the check his aunt had written.
		That night, Sebastian dreamt he was a young boy sitting at his piano bench.  He saw his tiny hands reach out and with a jab, he poked at one of the white keys nestled tightly between two raised black keys and listened for the piano to make a sound.  
		Silence.  
	The key was stuck.
		He fingered it again, this time harder and with more pressure, but the piano remained silent.  Frustrated, he began to repeatedly press down on the key, faster and faster, until it finally became unstuck, releasing the hammer, allowing it to strike the key for the first time in so long, letting out a sweet ‘G’ note.  The piano’s deep moan filled the room and then the entire house in his mind.  
		When he woke up, his ears were ringing and he was warm and moist below the belt. The streetlights buzzed outside and the darkness from outside crept through his windows as he returned to sleep and dream again. 
		In the next, Sebastian ran as fast as he could towards the conservatory.  He was twelve blocks away when, while crossing the street, he was struck by a bicyclist.  The bicyclist flipped over his handlebars as his bike followed him, flying through the air and just over Sebastian.  Midair, the chain caught hold of Sebastian’s suit coat and pulled him to the ground face first in front of the cyclist.  The cyclist picked himself up and dragged his bike out of the busy intersection.  He looked around for Sebastian angrily.
		Sebastian lay face-down and confused at the edge of the street with his hands flat against the pavement.  He pushed at the ground, but was struck in the head by a passing car, before he could make it to his feet.
		He woke the next day in the hospital wearing a brace on his neck and bandages over his hands.  Beside him were Isabella and his family and the song was playing.
		“I’m late,” he said, “What happened?”
		“You were hit by a car.”
		“The concert.” 
		“Marco filled in for you.”
		A doctor entered the room carrying x-rays of both Sebastian’s head and hands.
		“You’re lucky,” the doctor said as he removed the collar from Sebastian’s neck, “you’ve sustained no cervical damage whatsoever — truly extraordinary.”
	“I have to reschedule an audition.” Sebastian tried to sit up, but the doctor placed a hand on his shoulder and began to reason with him.  He explained the extensive damage to his hands using the X-ray images and plastic diagrams.  Wanting to punch something Sebastian tried to make a fist, but his fingers wouldn’t move.  He closed his eyes and imagined himself walking into the conservatory and sitting down next to Isabella at one of the pianos and beginning to play.  Sebastian opened his eyes as the doctor left and tried not to cry. The music grew loud to the point where Sebastian woke himself up. 
	His face was wet as he woke to the bright light from outside his window. He shut the curtain and began his day.  
	A week later, from her apartment, Bella heard Sebastian’s door slam louder than usual.  Curious, she crept to the door and looked through the peephole.  There was silence for a moment as she stared at the distorted yellow wall opposite her door, before Sebastian passed //blurrily by// quickly, duffel in hand.
	College visit, she thought and returned to her bedroom.  
	Although excited, Sebastian felt nervous in the passenger seat of the taxi that dropped him in front of the airport.  Clicks from the ‘departures’ board filled the terminal as Sebastian matched the number on his boarding pass to the bright yellow one towering above him.  He had allotted himself a spare hour in addition to that recommended by the FAA.  Halfway from the bottom, he found the flight to LAX.  The yellow tiles shuffled again, bumping his flight up a slot.
	Sebastian sat down at the departures terminal and placed his feet on the duffel, but not before he pulled out a paperback self-help book.  On the cover, a doctor and nurse helped a man in a hospital gown walk on a treadmill.  
	For ten minutes, Sebastian turned the pages and nodded occasionally.  Before long, he began to hum.  As he flipped to the third chapter, a page ripped and Sebastian became aware of his humming.  He coughed, grimaced, dog-eared his page, then stood.
	“Would you know where the ‘duty-free’ stores are?” he asked a uniformed woman.
	“Sorry, I think those are only in the international terminal.”
	“Thanks anyway,” Sebastian said and continued towards the second security checkpoint.  The line was short, but the smell from sweaty socks was pungent.  Sebastian wondered how much of the stench he had contributed.
	“Raise your arms,” the TSA agent waved his rectangular instrument over Sebastian, stopped at his belt, and tugged on the buckle, before giving him the go-ahead.  The agent seemed unfazed by the odor.
	“Does it smell?” Sebastian asked, before immediately regretting doing so.
	The TSA agent turned and smiled. “You get used to it,” he said and began waving over another passenger.
	“Now boarding: United flight 3818 to Houston,” a garbled voice on the intercom called, interrupting the smooth jazz of which Sebastian was now fully aware.  The music returned and he thought of the song that he hummed earlier, but only for a moment.  The sheet music for the song Sebastian had written three years prior was back at his apartment safely tucked away in a compartment of his piano bench.
	The crowd at Sebastian’s gate grew slowly over the next hour and eventually the voice from the intercom summoned the passengers to form a line at the gate.  The duffel dug into Sebastian’s shoulders as he shuffled back behind the first class passengers who had arrived minutes before the gate opened.  Once he made his way onto the airplane, he felt relieved as he squeezed past the passenger he would share a seat with, who was neither fat nor particularly smelly.  
	He left the self-help book in his duffel as the airplane taxied down the tarmac and took off.  With his head pressed against the window, Sebastian looked down at Milwaukee.  Through the clouds, he thought he saw the dome that sits atop the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, but he wasn’t certain.  He drifted off.
	The soft pinch of pressure and altitude change in Sebastian's ears woke him just before the tires made contact with concrete.  Drool formed a crust along the corners of Sebastian’s mouth that he smelled and tried to rub off as he looked through the terminal for Marco.  
	Sebastian stood still as the crowds of travelers swarmed and bustled around him.  He began to sweat and hiked his duffel higher onto his shoulder.  The crowds moved much faster than they had in Milwaukee and Sebastian looked around nervously, feeling out of place among all the determined faces that passed him.  Each had their own destination and life and story, goals, jobs, and hobbies.  
	He quickly reconsidered his plans.  Maybe, this was a bad idea.  I shouldn’t have come, he thought, before he saw Marco’s face across the room.  His hair, much longer than Sebastian remembered, covered half his face.  He glowed in stark contrast to Sebastian’s pale complexion.  
	Sebastian reached out his hand and was met with a hug.  An aura of sedation loomed around the airport, amidst the passersby.  Marco quickly shattered the relaxed atmosphere.
	“We’re gonna miss the tram!” he said, pulling Sebastian by the arm, joining the hustle and bustle of the airport crowd.  They snuck and snaked through families reuniting, chauffeurs waiting patiently, and other hurried faces.  Sebastian’s duffel, flung behind him, weighed him down in an anchor-like fashion, occasionally bumping into the backs of his knees.  //his winter jacket makes it noticeably warmer// Beads of sweat sat along Sebastian’s brow as they reached the bus stop just as the shuttle clad in cardinal with the gold letters ‘USC’ ribboned across the side sped off towards downtown Los Angeles.
	Instinctively, Sebastian reached into his duffel for his book with the broken spine as he sat on the bench, before doing a double take.  Marco sat down on the bench next to him and pointed towards the book.
	“You still read that?” 
	“It still helps, I think.”
	//chicken soup for the temporarily-disabled soul//
	Sebastian flipped through the pages and stopped at the front inside cover.  ‘Get better soon Seba! -Marco.’ Between the motivational anecdotes and recovery pseudoscience, the book offered something to look at while the body did its best healing.
	“No way, Lucas!”  Marco stood up and greeted a man wheeling a suitcase behind him with enthusiasm.  “What are you up to, flying in?”
	“Yeah, spent the week back home in Miami.  Is this your friend?”
	The two were introduced as they returned to the bench, Sebastian, Marco, then Lucas.  The conversation shifted from Sebastian to small talk and then to plans for the evening.  The shuttle returned and the three boarded.
	“What’s up with your girl?” Marco’s face went blank for a moment.  He looked toward Sebastian, then made a subtle glare at Lucas.  Marco shrugged, “when do you want to meet up tonight?”
	The shuttle arrived on campus.  “Good to meet you,” Sebastian said as he and Marco split to walk the few blocks to Marco’s house.  They walked between a low metal fence past brown grass up the wooden steps.  Bits of paint had peeled from the steps and sides of the house leaving it looking something like mint chocolate-chip ice cream.  
	Sebastian placed the duffel on the futon in the middle of the living room with worn hardwood floors.  There was a crash and then loud footsteps coming down the stairs.  Marco lived with three others and after a brief introduction, Sebastian tossed his now salty jacket on top of his duffel and followed Marco and his roommates outside, back towards campus, to a large open green space.  
	Sebastian struggled to keep up as they joined a pick-up game of frisbee.  His vision blurred and he reconsidered his decision not to change out of his jeans.  He stopped for a break and lit a cigarette.  He put the cigarette out prematurely following stares of disapproval from Marco, his roommates, and other passersby.  
	They continued to play until the sky turned from blue to orange and then purple around the edges.  As they walked towards home, Sebastian restrained himself from catching another drag until they arrived at a liquor store on a corner.  Sebastian grabbed a fifth of whiskey and snuck outside to smoke.  The street lights flickered on as Marco emerged from the store with two cases of lite beer.  “Reminds me of home,” he said.
	Sebastian stood quietly as Marco removed his bedroom door from the frame and placed it on the kitchen table.  He was unfamiliar with the drinking games that soon followed and filled his plastic cup with whiskey and ice.  Marco explained the rules, but Sebastian found himself losing and significantly more drunk than the others.  With one eye shut, he read the alcohol content of the beer and then filled his cup.  It tasted more like water than his whiskey and he found it easy to drink.
	He thought better than to bring his whiskey as they packed up beers and headed to another house nearby.  The lights were dim and the music was loud, Sebastian only stayed inside for a moment before posting up outside with his cigarettes.  Sebastian smiled, but remained quiet as a group of girls paused in front of the house, made sure they were at the right place, and then walked in past him.  It wasn’t long before Marco came out, asking if something was wrong.
	“No, I was just a little hot in there.  I guess I’m not used to this weather,” Sebastian said.
	“I think we’re headed to the bars soon.” 
	Sebastian lit another cigarette as Marco returned to the party.  The prospect of sitting down at a bar with an old fashioned enticed him, but when they arrived, the music was louder and somehow the bar was darker, save the strobe light.  Sebastian managed to squeeze through to the bar.  The stools had been removed earlier in the night to make room for more people so he leaned on the bar to rest.  When he lifted his arm to flag down a bartender, he found his sleeve covered in beer.  
	“Could I have an old fashioned?” he said, but the bartender squinted and pointed to his own ear.  Sebastian repeated his order and the bartender nodded.  A minute later the man returned with a clear plastic cup and handed it to Sebastian.  
	“How much?” he said, but the music had grown loud to the point where Sebastian couldn’t even hear the words come out of his mouth.
	The bartender showed the palms of both hand with fingers spread apart.  
	“Ten dollars,” he mouthed.  
	Sebastian payed, tipped, and took a sip of the drink -- a mix of vodka and energy drink.  He grimaced and was edged out from his place at the bar by a broad shouldered man clad in black.  
	He pushed out away from the bar and found Marco dancing under the strobe light.  Sebastian began to sweat as he mimicked Marco’s movements, much more awkwardly.  His hips felt sticky and unfamiliar.  He passed his drink from one hand to the other and wiped the sweat from both.  He brought the plastic cup to his lips and fumbled around with the straw and his tongue.  The girl Marco danced with pushed back into Sebastian’s arm and his drink fell to the ground with an upward splash that covered his legs and her dress.  He tried to apologize as Marco chased after her.
	The crowd and sweat became too much for Sebastian and he headed back outside for a smoke.  He felt a little woozy and dehydrated and his hands began to tremble and cramp as he tried to light his cigarette.  It tightened into a fist, crushing his last cigarette.  Frustrated, he turned back to the bar.  The long line of people that had grown since Sebastian arrived looked on, interested.  He walked to the end of the line, but by the time he made it to the door, Marco emerged with the girl he had been dancing with.  She kissed him and handed him a napkin with her number on it and then walked away.  
	“Head home?” he asked Sebastian and the two returned.  Sebastian curled up with a sheet on the futon and fell asleep.  He thought himself dreaming of a bright light, before he pulled the sheet over his eyes.  The time difference seemed not to help Sebastian like he thought.
	The house smelled of bacon and beer as Sebastian got up from the futon and walked into the kitchen.  His bare feet stuck to the spilt beer on the floor.  
	“Bloody?” he asked holding out a glass with string cheese and a hotdog floating in it.
	Sebastian held it with both hands and trying to avoid the mistakes from the night before, drank it slowly.  As his hangover drew to a close, Sebastian enjoyed himself more than he had yesterday.  He kept a buzz throughout the day by drinking the leftover beer and avoiding the whiskey.  Marco spent part of the day working on a project for school and left Sebastian in the company of his roommates.  
	He felt like an outsider at first, but before long, he bonded with them over drinks.  
	“How long have you known Marco?” one of them asked and Sebastian thought for a while. “I’ve known him since he first started playing the piano.”
	“Marco played the piano?” the other asked and Sebastian felt shocked.
	“Are you joking?” he asked, “Isn’t he in the music school, here?”
	The two roommates looked at each other then back at Sebastian.
	“We’re all in engineering together.” Sebastian took another sip of beer, looked down at his
	hands, and thought about the last time he saw Marco playing piano.  The day before the accident, or audition, Marco, Isabella, and Sebastian walked from the conservatory to the performing arts center.  They were met by the director of the conservatory, who let them into the auditorium.
		“I don’t expect that the auditorium will be filled by any means, but it will be one of the largest crowds for most of the other students in the showcase,” the director explained. He walked the high-schoolers to the stage, where the conservatory’s most expensive piano rested.  He then left the three pianists to spend the afternoon rehearsing and getting acquainted with the stage, acoustics, and the old piano.  Isabella and Sebastian leaned against the piano’s thick dark frame as Marco ran through his piece one last time.  
		Marco played with his left hand, turning the sheet music in front of him with his right, quickly brushing pieces of hair away from his face with the back of his forearm.  His fingers blurred in front of the others’ eyes in a dizzying fury.
	“We don’t look so intense when we play, do we?” Isabella whispered, turning her face away from the piano, close to Sebastian’s ear.  She brushed his cheek with hers and tickled his neck with her few loose hairs.
		Afternoon turned to evening, and Marco, Sebastian, and Isabella were ushered from the building by members of the custodial staff.  Marco hopped on the bus back towards his house and Sebastian and Isabella walked along Water Street together to where both their families lived.
	“Nervous?” he asked, as he stopped in front of her house, turning to stand facing her.
	“We’ll do great,” she said as she stood on her toes to hug him and gave him a kiss on the cheek, the way his aunt would do before pinching it.  She walked inside and he continued home.
	Still buzzed in LA, Sebastian rubbed the side of his cheek with his open, scarred hand, then reached for more beer.  The roommates had changed the topic of conversation to a test they had recently taken.  
	“Are you boring my friend with engineering?” Marco asked as he walked in the door.
	“You played the piano?” one asked and Marco went white.
	“Yeah,” he said, close to a whisper, looking at Sebastian.
	“I haven’t played in a while, though...” his voice trailed off as he walked into the kitchen for a beer.  “Do I have to play ‘catch-up’?”
		They drank until the early evening, ordered a pizza, and then pulled a door back over the kitchen table.  Sebastian followed cues from Marco’s roommates and learned how to avoid the stupor of the previous night as he played.  When they arrived at the bar, Sebastian tried to ask Marco about engineering and piano, but the sounds drowned him out.  He gave up and grabbed a beer at the bar.  It wasn’t as light or cheap as what he had been drinking all day, but he drank it just as quick and moved awkwardly back towards Marco.  It was a cross between walking while trying not to spill a drink, but his smile made it less awkward.
		He tried to copy Marco and his roommates and their dancing until the bar closed.  They walked home together and Sebastian handed cigarettes out to the two roommates.  “I only smoke when I drink,” one said.
		Sebastian’s grin nearly fell from his face when he lit theirs.  
	“Marco?” he held out his pack.
	“Nah.”
	“I feel,” Sebastian slurred as they walked up the steps to the house, “good.” He grabbed the rest of his whiskey from his bag and his book fell out. He thought, for a moment, about when Marco had given it to him. The summer after graduation, after the accident, Marco came to Sebastian’s house. He was in bed, but smiled when Marco walked in. Isabella came through the door not long after. The three talked excitedly about Isabella and her acceptance to Columbia in New York and then Marco handed him the book and they talked some more. Before they left, Isabella leaned over Sebastian and gave him a hug. Her hair, tied up behind her head, left her cheek bare as it hovered inches from Sebastian’s. They were gone. Sebastian picked up the book.
	He placed it back in the bag and moved into the living room with the whiskey.
	“When did you stop playing?” Sebastian asked, pouring whiskey into plastic cups.
	“Same as you,” he said, “it was always my plan.”
	“Anyone can be an engineer” Sebastian said. “We had potential.”
	“There’s money in engineering.” His response didn’t satisfy Sebastian, who finished his drink and poured another.
	“You want water?” Marco asked, seeing Sebastian’s eyes glaze over a bit.
	“I’m fine,” he said, “I just don’t get it.” His voice grew louder and his words more slurred and then they were nonsensical. “But… just, you know?” His eyes were open slightly, but his head tilted back over the couch and then he was snoring. 
	 In the morning, Sebastian woke to Marco cleaning the whiskey and beer from the table.
	“You’re up, good,” Marco said. 
	Sebastian looked at his watch and sat up. He spoke little as he packed up his bag and got ready to head back to Milwaukee. They didn’t talk about much until the shuttle neared the terminal.
	“Izzy came up here a few weeks ago,” Marco said, “she asked about you.”
	They spoke for a while before Sebastian hopped off the tram, a bit hungover and upset.
	With nothing but time to reminisce and hum, Sebastian sank into the seat at his gate and closed his eyes.  //years ago, writing on blank sheet music//
	The taxi pulled away and Sebastian returned to his apartment.  Dropping his duffel, he went straight to the piano bench and lifted the cover.  Underneath old medical records and concert pieces, Sebastian pulled a lengthy piece of sheet music with handwritten notes.  Underneath the pen marks on the page, there were the ghosts of notes written and erased in pencil.  Carefully, he unfolded the paper and placed it on the piano.  He closed the lid of the bench and sat down the way he hadn’t in so long.  
	After a deep breath, Sebastian held his hands out in front of him, looking at the scars that still seemed foreign.  The stretches he used to do before each day of practice came back naturally and before long, Sebastian felt like he had his old dexterity back.
	His chest puffed out and his back straightened up.  His eyes moved through the first few measures on the page and the song began to come alive in his mind.  He pulled his toes up to the pedals and held his hands out over the keys, worn from generations of use.  
	I’ll take it slow, he thought and began to move his hands up and down the piano to the positions dictated by the sheet music.  The dull thud of the the pedals was muted in Sebastian’s head as his song blared through his imagination.  There was a crescendo, and Sebastian began to sweat.  His hands moved faster from place to place as his head began to shake and nod along with his imaginary music.  He found himself no longer needing to read the sheet music.  He closed his eyes and was pulled into himself.
	There she was, off-stage, but just in sight; Isabella was watching him perform.  He turned to the audience whose faces were masked by the stage lights.  He felt the heat of the performance inside of him.  Another crescendo and a bead of sweat rolled down his neck behind his collar.
	So close to the end, he could feel the audience’s anticipation.  He continued to play the last few measures, but his mind was focused sharply on the last note.  
	It has to be solid, he thought. //a gymnast sticks a landing//
	He came to the last bar, with one foot on the pedal and swung at the last note.  The echo of the last note on the hall died slowly in his mind and the landing was stuck.  Tension gave way to applause and Sebastian opened his eyes with a grin.
	This time for real, he thought and touched the keys with the tips of his fingers.  It had been years and the touch of the keys and sweat caught Sebastian off guard.  He looked back at the first measure and pressed down with his hands.  
	Something was off and Sebastian heard it immediately.  He stopped and reconsidered warming up.  He ran through a quick scale and the out-of-tune nature of his piano became clear.  Even with that, though, the sounds were choppy and poorly timed.  
	I’ll have it tuned soon.  He decided to return to his song and set his fingers back in the ready position.  There was a pause as Sebastian took a quick breath and started the first measure once more.  He grimaced, but continued.  His chest shrank as he turned his head to the side.  His hands began to sweat profusely and Sebastian began to realize that his fingers were swelling.  His eyes were fixed on the red of his hands that seemed to be worsening.  The sounds coming from the piano were further from what he imagined than ever.  His left hand shook.  There was silence as Sebastian pulled back from the keys and rubbed his left hand with his right.
	He tried to stretch his hand and it cramped.  Clenched tightly in a fist now, he set his hand in his lap and sighed.  He picked through his other sheet music and found a small sheet from a concert in middle school. He remembered the stack of letters that he had been ignoring, but that one was from his school. He thought of Marco and Isabella and the time they spent together through their younger years and how long it had been since he saw Isabella. He pulled from the envelopes of unopened mail, one addressed to him with the seal of Roosevelt, School of the Arts. Fumbling with his thumbs, he tore it open, ripping the corner of the letter apart. It was dated from a few months prior and had an “address-changed” stamp over the corner. 
	He read, folded, and placed the torn letter in his pocket. Quickly moving for the door, he nearly forgot his coat. He ran down the hall, out the door, and onto the street corner. His mind raced as he hopped on the bus towards where he attended middle school. His thoughts bounced from the song he had written to his middle school and back again until he neared his stop.
	He pulled the letter from his pocket and his eyes welled up as he read it over. Stepping from the bus, he looked up from the letter to where his middle school used to be and saw an empty lot. There had been a referendum and the school was closed. He crumpled the piece of paper and tossed it over the chain-link fence, humming and trying not to cry as he headed back to his apartment.
	No more than a minute before he was home, Bella knocked on his door.
	“Jazz in the Park?” she asked. and 
	He looked at his watch.
	“It started ten minutes ago.” Bella had a blanket folded over her arm and Sebastian thought she must’ve been waiting for him.
	“Sure,” he said, and grabbed a bottle of wine before they walked to Cathedral Square, into a crowd of quiet people, listening to jazz. The amphitheatre was colossal and bright white in contrast to the darkening sky. On the left edge of the trees, St. John’s Cathedral towered over the park. Sebastian looked at his watch and then at the clock-tower's frozen hands. Before they sat down, Bella took Sebastian around the back of the stage.
	Beyond a temporary barricade of orange plastic stood musicians and their instruments waiting for their turn to perform. She waved over a tall, mustached man with a trilby hat covering his close-shaven head. A golden saxophone, hung around his neck, reflected the lights hanging in the park.
	They talked through the barricade for a minute before Bella turned to Sebastian.
	“This is an old friend of mine,” she said.
	“Dory,” he introduced himself. 
	“He owns a print shop in Bay View. I told him you might be interested in a job.”
	“I have a sales rep position open and Bella told me good things about you.” 
	Sebastian couldn’t remember mentioning his lack of work to his super, but he took the man’s information nonetheless. “Don’t worry, if you can dial a phone, you can handle the job.” Sebastian became quiet, unsure of how to respond.
	The music stopped and Dory left quickly to get on stage.
	“How do you know him?” Sebastian asked as they set the blanket down near the back of the park.
	“We used to jam together at the piano bar down the street,” she said, catching Sebastian by surprise.
	“You never told me...” he went on as they sat and talked over wine and music. When they went back to Sebastian’s apartment, he pulled out some of his old sheet music, and he sat on the bench next to her as she fingered through them.  He pulled out the song he’d written, held it for a moment and then placed it behind the others.
	He remembered when he had first written it, right after the accident. It was the last time he had been excited about the piano. 
	When he was well enough to leave the hospital, he went to the conservatory to meet Isabella. They went through the song together, one note at a time. While he whistled and hummed and called out notes, she wrote. After three hours, they were finished with seven pages of sheet music.
		“Could you play it for me?” he asked.
	Isabella tried to play the song, but halfway through, he stopped her. Something was wrong. The song that she was playing didn’t sound the same as the one running through his head. It was getting late, though, and Isabella seemed on edge. She looked at her watch more and more frequently and eventually she got up from the bench, hugged Sebastian, and left. 
	Sebastian packed up the sheet music and walked out the front door of the conservatory. It was dark, but Sebastian thought he saw Isabella under a streetlamp down the road.  He tried to walk faster, wondering why they hadn’t decided to walk home together, but stopped short as another figure came under the light. Sebastian dipped behind a tree as the two embraced, kissed, and walked away together. 
	The words Marco said on the shuttle before Sebastian left for home echoed through his mind to the rhythm of his unplayable song, “I started seeing her over that summer, you can’t hold that over her head.”
	“I think that’s it,” Bella said, “too tired,” as she left Sebastian at his piano.
	From his window, Sebastian could see a crowd forming at the piano bar down the street and wondered who would be performing.  He put his coat on and walked through the front door, slamming it.
	“Schlitz,” Sebastian said and then turned towards the stage.  A small band took the stage and began to perform.  There were a few that Sebastian had heard, but never played.  The piano at the corner of the stage stood empty for most of the night.  
	“I’ll take another,” he told the barkeep, “you know...  //he says something to the bartender and it is clear he is lonely//”
	The bartender continues to serve and put up with Sebastian’s rants.
	Sebastian downed a few more beers before a musician made his way towards the piano and spoke softly into the microphone.  “This is a spin on a classic and one of my personal favorites.”
	The pianist plays a song that Sebastian was once familiar with. //taking liberties with the song; there is wild applause//
	“That’s not how it goes,” Sebastian shouted towards the bartender who had become increasingly busier as the crowd in the bar grew.
	“That last part was all supposed to be...” Sebastian looked up from the bar and realized that he was talking to himself and whispered, “staccato...” //three short syllables// Sebastian stands from his barstool and felt more drunk than he had sitting down.  He nearly dropped his beer as he walked towards the exit.  He cocked his head to the side as he passed the stage and thought he saw the pianist shoot him a wink.  Shuffling through the crowd, Sebastian moved closer to the stage and then lunged for the microphone.
		“You’re playing it…” he slurred “… wrong.” 
	Then he turned to the pianist.
	To Sebastian, the pianist looked a lot like Marco.  Something snapped. He thought back to the last time he saw Isabella under the streetlamp and saw Marco kissing her as he spit beer into the pianist’s face.
	The entire band set down their instruments and converged on the piano, easily restrained Sebastian and held him upright for the pianist to punch him in the gut three times.  After one last right hook to the face, the pianist wiped his hands on Sebastian’s shirt and threw him out.
		Sebastian stumbled out of the bar, bleeding from the mouth, still grasping his bottle of beer, up the street and into his apartment building.  As he walked up the front stairs, he heard the song he wrote echo through his mind.  He tried to block it out with a mental brick-wall.  //cream-colored bricks// 
	Stopping outside of Bella’s apartment, he leaned against the wall and polished off his beer.  His attempt to drown out the sound failed as the song continued to ring through the hall.
		Determined now to return to his flat and destroy the piano, in the hopes of shutting it out forever, he walked to his door.  The sound had grown louder, as had his impatience and anger.  He tried to slide his key into the door as music continued to play as the last wave of alcohol washed over him.
		Bella woke suddenly to the shattering of glass from the hall.  The hems of her sweatpants snuck underneath her feet as she slid them into her slippers and walked into the living room.  She thought her father, still passed out on the couch, seemed not to notice the sound; briefly forgetting. Through the peephole in the door, Bella saw nothing.  She cracked open the door a bit and saw Sebastian slumped against his door down the hall, surrounded by shards of his broken beer bottle with his keys resting in his open palm.  
		“Sebastian?” she whispered with force.
		Slowly, she walked between the pieces of glass, pausing occasionally to sweep a few pieces to the side with her foot.  Sebastian was breathing heavily with his chin rested on his chest.  He mumbled, but didn’t wake as Bella took the keys from his hand and opened the door to his apartment.  With one hand on the knob and the other around his wrists, she lowered him to the floor in the open doorway.  
		With the help of the doorframe, Bella lifted Sebastian the way she used to lift her father and dragged him to the couch.  Sebastian turned to his side and curled up on his sofa before beginning to shiver.  Bella looked around the living room then towards the bedroom door.  She thought better than to violate his personal space and went back to her apartment.  She opened the small closet where a few old oxygen tanks had been gathering dust and reached for her father’s old blanket on the top shelf.  There was a little dust, but she was certain Sebastian wouldn't mind.
		She returned to Sebastian's apartment and covered him with the blanket.  The morning sounds of doves and cars began to fill the apartment and Bella realized that the sun would soon be rising.  She thought about returning to her apartment, and decided to wait instead.   
		Sebastian heard the song playing in his head as he tried to open his eyes.  Light from the mid-morning sun snuck through the shades.  He winced, groaned, and propped his right side against the arm of his couch.  He touched the swollen area around his eye and wondered if it had bruised yet.  Sebastian felt certain that he was hearing his song, but there were pauses and missed notes.  The song seemed more foreign than he had ever heard.  It continued to play as he swung his legs from the couch, righting himself completely.  His shoes, still on his feet, made a thud when they hit the ground and the music stopped.  
		The brightness of his living room slowed Sebastian’s eyes from adjusting.  Across the room, a shape formed at the piano.  Sebastian hadn’t been to church since he was a boy, but for a moment, hungover, in the bright light, he thought there was an angel sitting at his piano.  
		“Did I play it right?” the woman asked.  Her voice, familiar to him, was therapeutic and distracted him from his headache.  Sebastian began to see her more clearly as he traced the shape of her body with his eyes.  Once Sebastian could see her face, he recognized her.  Something about her seemed different to him, though.  He tried to figure it out, but gave up shortly thereafter.
		“That’s it,” he lied and moved to sit next to her on the piano bench. His eyes passed over the cracks in the bricks beyond the piano as he turned to kiss his super. </p>
